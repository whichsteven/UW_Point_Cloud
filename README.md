<h2><b>Introduction</b></h2>
This project provides people with a new travel experience in the form of point cloud visualization. It mainly shows the buildings of the School of Environmental and Forest Sciences. The three parts of the campus of the University of Washington Forestry Department are Anderson Hall (1925), Winkenwerder Hall and Bloedel Hall. The three buildings are located on the southeastern edge of the campus and form a quiet wooded ensemble, surrounding a calm central courtyard. In the project, the point-cloud view can be adjusted to various angles to achieve the most immersive experience.

<h2><b>Function</b></h2>

The main page briefly introduce these three buildings. It helps people to have a big picture about the tour before they get into the point cloud virtualization page.

After clicking the "Click Here" button, the second page shows like this:

On the left-up corner, there are three options to choose to adjust different levels of resolution. Re-Center can reset the view angle.
